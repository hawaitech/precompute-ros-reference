# Precompute ROS Reference

## Overview

This repository provides a GitHub action and utilities to precompute a reference of all ROS2 packages in a given project and of the nodes, launch files and interfaces they provide. Then the reference is meant to be included in a documentation of the project. The action [Sphinx-Build](https://github.com/hawaitech/sphinx-build.git) can be used to create such a documentation.

## Usage
